He's a prisoner and now resides in the Northern District and the current leader of SCRATCH. He's body is pretty built, he wears a military-like outfit and his hair is in dreadlocks with some beads and feathers of his Allmate at end of his front locks. His Allmate is a male (they say it was a BITCH) pink cockatoo named TORI with a pretty big voice. Mink's attitude is quite bad, but I love it so yeah~<br>He has an H-SCENE with Aoba! There's only one CG for it, but he ****ed Aoba three times~ The last one kinda failed, cause Aoba's other self took hold of the situation..<br>****<br><div><span><b>His path: </b></span></div><div>Hesitate</div><div>Fight Back</div><div>No way</div><div>I have to bear with this</div><div>Hurry Inside</div><div>Search for Clear</div><div>Listen to Mink<br><b><span>THINK ABOUT MINK</span></b></div><div><i><span>(there will be other three choices before the MAIN QUESTIONS)</span></i></div><div>DOWN / I don't want to use a gun</div><div><i><span>(then at the MAIN QUESTIONS)</span></i></div><div><span><b>GOOD ENDING:</b></span></div><div>DON'T HELP / down</div><div><b><span>BAD ENDING:</span></b></div><div>HELP / up</div><br>****<br><img src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xPuAbT0Jhqo/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Dramatical murder reconnect game online' title='Dramatical murder reconnect game online'><img src='https://bleedingrapture.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/dramaticalmurderreconnect-patch.jpg' alt='Dramatical Murder Reconnect English Patch' title='Dramatical Murder Reconnect English Patch'><img src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_YHLsUIQ6Fg/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Dramatical' title='Dramatical'>Well, like I've said before, Mink's attitude is pretty bad but he actually helped Aoba. Tae-san was kidnapped by Morphine, and at that same time, Aoba received a game demo from Captive Princess - showing a knight in blue who went to a castle like place but the princess(?) was captured by some bats as she was about to open up the doors and was dragged away from the castle, upward to a small room. When Aoba reached home, the door was opened but a man was laying in front of his doorstep and a really big figure appeared and soon knocked him down. At Mink's hideout, the SCRATCH members tried to molest Aoba but then Aoba's other self took hold and he soon lost consciousness. Mink offered Aoba his help but in exchange Aoba must repay him somehow. Mink also knew about Aoba's powers. Mink is usually very cold to Aoba but the 'hair' scene was like the only thing that the DMMd fans like about him!<br><span><b>PAST:</b></span><br>Mink is from a village where they could understand the scent of people easily but said village was slaughter by Toue. I'm still not sure why Mink got/became a prisoner but it was probably because Toue hated him. So yeah, Toue tried creating his own version of SCRAP but it turned out to be a failure thus turning his eyes permanently gold.<br><span><b>PRESENT:</b></span><h2 id='dramatical-murder-reconnect-english-patch'>Dramatical Murder Reconnect English Patch</h2><br>At the Opal Tower, Toue welcomed them and told them about his plans and all. Mink was seen totally angry with Toue while at it. Toue then introduced them a man in white clothing with a smiling mask. The man then sang a song and everything turned upside down for Mink and Aoba. Aoba tried to fight back and when he regained consciousness, he went to find Mink but he seemed to be under the influence of the song so Aoba used his powers to help him.<br><div><b><span><u>BAD ENDING:</u></span></b></div><div><br></div><div>Aoba went inside Mink's head and saw a village being slaughter. Aoba helped the man/people he saw. He then transferred to a different scene where he saw a place full of chains and Mink was there standing on the other side, Mink then told Aoba that they should leave. When they got back to the real world. Mink acted strange, because he doesn't want to go after Toue but forced Aoba back to his head. Mink then hold Aoba's head and told him that he can protect Aoba. He put his hand on Aoba's head and the other on his (Aoba's) shoulders, Aoba then panicked but as he called out to Mink, everything went black. Mink took Aoba's head. He then whispered some words saying that Aoba's soul will comfort him forever.</div><br><div>When Aoba was inside Mink's head, he didn't helped anyone and just went on the other part of his head. Aoba's then saw a place full of chains as he tried to look closely, Mink was there inside and was chained up. Aoba called up to Mink but while at it, Aoba remembered his past. That he used to fight in Rhyme and he did had a really big blow. Voices of two men can be heard, Virus and Trip. When he woke up, they went to find Toue. Mink was quite different, he was kinda soft while talking for a moment. While fighting Akushima-san, Aoba was then injured - Mink ordered his men to stick with Aoba while he fights alone with Toue. Aoba then fight Akushima-san and dear o dear~ That gun is amazing~!!! Aoba used his SCRAP to Akushima to end it all. On a different scene, Mink managed to fight Toue and ended up killing him in the process. Mink offered his prayers to Toue as the Opal Tower crumbles into pieces. Aoba managed to leave the tower because of Mink's men. </div><br><div>After a month or so, Mink was never found and the Platinum Jail's barrier/wall was opened. Aoba was very worried about it and so he talked to Tae-san and left Midorijima. On the country side he saw a pink cockatoo and followed it until he saw a tall figure of a man with long brown hair. As the man turned around, it was Mink without his braided hair and wearing different clothes. His eyes had turned gold - probably saying that he got Toue's artificial powers. </div><h2 id='dramatical-murder-reconnect-english'>Dramatical Murder Reconnect English</h2><div><br></div><br><b>NOTE:</b><i>Akushima-san is the main antagonist here</i><br>****<br>I really, really love MINK~!!! he's sooo amazing! His body is sooo cool and I just love looking at him, his voice turns me on so bad and I can't stop myself from loving him, this is sooo wrong and all of my friends think of this as something sooo wrong but I really love him!!! I can't help it, he's sooo amazing! I love him! His attitude is sooo cool~!! AHHHH~!!!!<br>I don't like his portion of the DMMd Green Island Radio Drama..they made him boring..but I love it when he answered the questions on the Q&amp;A. There's actually someone important in his life, he's in love with someone!<br><span>(c)Nitro+Chiral</span><h2>Where to buy DMMd re:connect (fandisc/sequel)</h2><h2 id='dramatical-murder-reconnect-english-patch-notes'>Dramatical Murder Reconnect English Patch Notes</h2><h3><strong>Online Stores</strong><br> (will need a Proxy)<br><strong>Amazon (JP)</strong> (will need a Proxy)<strong><br></strong><strong>eBay</strong></h3><h3><strong>Proxies (see here for definition)</strong><br><strong>From Japan<br></strong><strong>DankeDanke<br></strong><strong>Celga<br></strong><strong>Tenso</strong></h3><h3><strong>Forwarding Services</strong><br><strong>Big in Japan</strong><strong><br>Tenso</strong></h3><p>A little guide to this list for those who are interested in buying the game.</p><p>Buy Syberia Trilogy BUNDLE (?)

Selling at roughly $59 they by far and large have the cheapest rate available and they ship internationally to boot – so you won’t spend more than $70. Beware though, you need a credit card to buy it and can’t use Paypal.</p><p>Otherwise the next option is by buying the game yourself through JP!Amazon in conjunction with the forwarding service Big in Japan. Their forwarding service itself costs roughly $5, so with this option you’d be paying the price of the game itself, the forwarding service ($5) and the shipping from BiJ to you. Depending on how low the price is on Amazon of your order, the total can range anywhere between +$60~$80.</p><p>If you want someone else to handle the order for you and you’re ok with paying a bit more, your next bet is using the proxy From Japan to buy the game through either JP!Amazon or Nitro+’s official store. With the game’s price at roughly $65 (note: the price on JP!Amazon fluctuates a lot, sometimes it can go as low as roughly +$50) and the proxy service + shipping costs, you’ll likely spend anywhere between $80~$100. </p><p>However if you can’t be assed to deal with proxies, one particular listing on eBay is going for $89 with Free Worldwide Shipping. <a href='/sid-meiers-civilization-v-for-mac.html' title='Sid meier' s="" civilization="" v="" cheats'="">Sid meier's civilization v cheats</a>.</p><p>Feel free to give a heads up if you have any other links (proxy or store) to add to this list.</p></div><footer class="col-clear-body"><div class="col-clear-body-inner"></div></footer></article><nav id="menu-fn-items"><div class="menu-fn-items-inner"><h1 class="lg-entry-node page-single-secondary">Post navigation</h1><div class="menu-singular-nav"><a href="/photoshop-mac-free-trial.html">Photoshop Mac Free Trial</a></div><div class="list-fix-static"><a href="/skyrim-best-vampire-race.html">Skyrim Best Vampire Race</a></div></div></nav></div><div id="items-fix-secondary" class="panel-row-default main-post-single" role="complementary"><aside id="primary-aside-item" class="layer-singular-row clear-col-area"><form role="search" method="get" id="singular-body-col" class="item-fix-singular" action="#"><div><label class="content-layout-lg" for="s">Search for:</label><input type="text" value="" name="s" id="site-abbr-md"><input type="submit" id="layer-aside-fix" value="Search"></div></form></aside><aside id="aside-layout-singular" class="clear-col-area layout-md-post"><h2 class="node-site-box">Related Articles</h2><ul><li><a href='/portal-crack.html'>Portal Crack</a></li><li><a href='/crusader-kings-iii-for-mac.html'>Crusader Kings III For Mac</a></li><li><a href='/santas-big-adventures-crack.html'>Santa's Big Adventures Crack</a></li><li><a href='/total-war-warhammer-norsca-download-for-mac.html'>Total War: WARHAMMER - Norsca Download For Mac</a></li><li><a href='/youtubers-life-download-for-mac.html'>Youtubers Life Download For Mac</a></li><li><a href='/total-war-attila-the-last-roman-campaign-pack-for-mac.html'>Total War: ATTILA - The Last Roman Campaign Pack For Mac</a></li><li><a href='/demon-hunter-4-riddles-of-light-for-mac.html'>Demon Hunter 4: Riddles Of Light For Mac</a></li></ul></aside></div></div><footer id="page-aside-lg" role="contentinfo" class="clear"><div id="clear-page-entry" class="clear fix"></div></footer></div></body></html>
