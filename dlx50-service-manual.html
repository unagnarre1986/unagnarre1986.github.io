If your dirt bike won't start or stay running, it's known by all how frustrating and embarrassing this can be. Even more so after you've run the battery down or tried push starting it, yet it still won't start and run properly, all the while other people on a ride are waiting on you. Even a nice ride that occasionally has starting or staying running issues can start to seem like a POS, although a dirt bike that has starting or staying running issues, usually has an easily correctable condition that's easily diagnosable using basic tools and a systematic approach, so we're going to go over the most common reasons why dirt bikes don't start (barring any catastrophic engine damage), and show you some real world tips that anyone can do that'll get the most stubborn motorcycle back to running reliably. If it's electric start and nothing happens, or it just 'clicks' when you press the start button, Our section on what to do when it's dead or just clicks should be a must see before doing anything else. If the motorcycle is equipped with electric start and it appears lifeless, you'll want to first check whether or not the battery or electrical system is completely dead which is easiest accomplished by checking for headlight or taillight illumination and intensity, as well as whether the horn or any other accessories work.<br>Whether it's routine maintenance, such as tune-ups, timing, brake service, or more extensive repairs involving engine and transmission, our Service and Repair Manuals provide reliable information required to perform the job. Accurate, clear text, combined with detailed illustrations, make it possible for the novice enthusiast to safely service their Chinese ATV, Go Kart, Scooter, UTV, Moped, Dirt Bike, Mini Bike, or other vehicle. While at the same time, the in-depth coverage provides indispensable information for those tackling more complicated procedures. We have frequent specials and are adding new Service and Repair Manuals all the time so be sure and check back often.<br>Riding a 50cc (cubic centimeter) dirt bike can be exhilarating, convenient and efficient. These bikes are the most powerful you can ride without a special license, and they are gas efficient, relatively inexpensive and in some cases street legal. It is not uncommon, however, for riders to crave a bit more speed than the small engine initially offers. A dirt bike from the manufacturer has a maximum speed between 25 and 45 mph, depending on the make and model, but with certain modifications can achieve a maximum speed of 65 mph.

I've e-mailed the company and they make hundreds of thousands of those motors in china for the mopeds over there. I know the little pocket bikes are decent if you can work on them yourself, otherwise, spend the money on a name brand bike. Where they are better is that they are a four speed have larger valves and ports. Their # is 626-336-1128Some knockoffs are so good..every piece will interchange.so much with these.

There are some simple details that need attension with the Panterra, such as an air box that needs some help. I become so facinated with this bike that I have set myself up as a Panterra Service Center and now have or can get parts. I also know what parts off other bikes work...... Ramco I ALSO HAVE 1 Of those bikes, its great I ve been looking for some mods, for onething, when they copied the pw 80,but changed it to 4 stroke, they left the pw's 2 stroke pipe on it, do you know if the xr 50 pipe will workwhat other parts are interchangeable? I ve been looking for some mods, for onething, when they copied the pw 80,but changed it to 4 stroke, they left the pw's 2 stroke pipe on it, do you know if the xr 50 pipe will work what other parts are interchangeable? Those darn Chinese knock off engineers are so smart. I was thinking of converting my Toyota Landcruiser to a two stroke diesel engine. I pulled the head off and replaced the valves with little tiny carbon fiber reeds (it looks tight! it looks like this but behind the screw Those darn Chinese knock off engineers are so smart. ) The biggest problem I am having now is how to change the crankshaft timing. i need idk if its a ball gasket or a oil seal but when i shift and the bike starts going fast it kicks back a bunch of times so i just tighten both bolts on both sides and it looks on the left the plastic oring around the bolt is ripped and gone.

Even more so after you've run the battery down or tried push starting it, yet it still won't start and run properly, all the while other people on a ride are waiting on you. Even a nice ride that occasionally has starting or staying running issues can start to seem like a POS, although a dirt bike that has starting or staying running issues, usually has an easily correctable condition that's easily diagnosable using basic tools and a systematic approach, so we're going to go over the most common reasons why dirt bikes don't start (barring any catastrophic engine damage), and show you some real world tips that anyone can do that'll get the most stubborn motorcycle back to running reliably. If it's electric start and nothing happens, or it just 'clicks' when you press the start button, Our section on what to do when it's dead or just clicks should be a must see before doing anything else. If the motorcycle is equipped with electric start and it appears lifeless, you'll want to first check whether or not the battery or electrical system is completely dead which is easiest accomplished by checking for headlight or taillight illumination and intensity, as well as whether the horn or any other accessories work. Alternatively, the battery's state of charge can be tested using a battery load tester ideally, however for the DIY home mechanic a Digital Volt &amp; Ohm Meter (DVOM) or even a cheap test light will suffice and let you know if the battery has voltage available. If the battery even as much as illuminates a test light (or headlamp), or makes your DVOM display close to 12 volts at the battery we need to find out how far the battery power is reaching by ensuring the key (if present) and any 'Run/Off' switches are on, followed by ensuring that all connections at the battery and starter solenoid are clean, secure, undamaged and tight, then be sure to review the tips on How To Diagnose Why My E Start Bike Wont Start. Presuming its kick start or the E start is working and the engine is turning over, the first thing to do when diagnosing why any dirt bike won't start, is to ensure the 4 basic necessities listed below are met. Any dirt bike, whether it be a 2 stroke or 4 stroke, MUST have these 4 prerequisites to start and run: Keep in mind during your diagnosis that everything besides Air, Fuel, Compression and Spark is more less just along for the ride when it comes down to a dirt bike running, or not running but this doesn't mean to pull the pipe or intake boot off in a process of elimination as there's not generally much to see, or need to remove these components for proper diagnosis of a 'No Start' condition, nor when diagnosing why a motorcycle won't run (or stay running) or is routinely hard to start. If you're kicking a 2 stroke to death, or running the battery down repeatedly and swapping spark plugs but the dirt bike won't start, or is extremely hard to start and the bike has a reed block, the reeds may be in a less than ideal condition, as the reed petals do get worn on 2 strokes which results in the petals becoming flayed, broken, chipped, split, cracked or just not sealing well to the reed block but these conditions generally result in poor performance more so than leaving you left with a dirt bike that won't start. Should you find that the reeds are lifted and not sealing flat, do NOT flip them. Worn reeds should only be replaced, and never flipped otherwise the engine may be inhaling parts of the reed petal(s). If you happened to get called out on a nasty looking air filter, you may want to replace the spark plug while you're giving the dirt bike some needed attention. Since you're the one with a bike that won't start and the problem may be related to the engine having been unable to breathe, after this startling revelation of how the air filter looks, a new spark plug should be a must, along with a Compression Test while the spark plug is out just to check out the condition of the top end after running with a choked up, dirty or worse; Torn air filter allowing dirt and particles to reach the engine which will greatly accelerate the wear of internal parts resulting in low compression and lots of damage. The safest bet for getting the most longevity out of any engine is to keep an eye on the air filter and check out the article on: Keeping your air filter and intake clean as if the motor depends upon it. If you're pretty sure there is no gas reaching the engine, the carburetor likely needs a full disassembly and cleaning but before pulling the carb off there are a couple things you can check to see just how far through the carb the gas is making it. Here's how to rebuild a carburetor yourself, although if you're hesitant, I assure you that a complete disassembly and cleaning of a motorcycle carburetor is not difficult, although you may want to grab a service manual specific to the bike you're working on for specifics related to the motorcycle being serviced. Fuel injected bikes are not difficult to diagnose and often perform flawlessly with minimal maintenance, however since off-road motorcycles are subjected to some pretty harsh conditions, problems with the FI system on a motorcycle can develop (which are usually electrical related) and can be easily diagnosed at home with a cheap DVOM or a basic 12V DC test light following the guidance below, although a factory service manual specific to the motorcycle will provide invaluable wiring schematics and additional 'built in' on board diagnostic procedures specific to the motorcycle. With the vast assortment of FI dirt bikes from battery-less kick start models, to battery equipped, electric start models, were gonna focus on what the fuel injection system requires for the motorcycle to run with less emphasis on model specific details. Fuel injected motorcycles rely upon a fuel system that is pressurized by an electric fuel pump. All electrical connections within the fuel pump's electrical circuit must be clean and tight to allow sufficient current (amperage) to the pump for it to be able to develop and maintain adequate fuel system pressure. Check the fuel pump for power and a ground with a DVOM or test light by back probing the electrical connector nearest the fuel pump. Should power or ground be absent, check all the motorcycle's fuses, followed by a thorough inspection of all the wiring under the gas tank, seat or side / front panels / number plates while looking for any chaffing or other damage to the harness, as well as ensuring no electrical connectors have become partially separated. If you have power and a ground to the fuel pump, but the pump is not running, as a diagnostic aid for motorcycles with an in-tank fuel pump, it is often possible to forcefully strike the gas tank nearest the fuel pump with the heel of your palm or a mallet and get an in tank pump to work temporarily, however if this gets the bike running, it is strongly advised that you replace the intank fuel pump immediately. As part of your preliminary diagnosis, you'll want to ensure that the electrical connector at the fuel injector(s) are undamaged, secure and have 12V of continuous power to one side of the plug and a pulsing ground to the other, anytime the engine is being cranked as the injector(s) are frequently powered by a constant power supply while the ECM sends a ground signal to the non powered wire to control when and for how long the injector is 'fired' / enabled / turned on which is controlled by the ECM and is referred to as injector pulse width. Should the noid light not flash during cranking, it will be likely that there will be no spark at the spark plug either. At this point it will be necessary to check for an independent power supply and pulsating ground at the injector with a test light. Should voltage or a pulsating ground be absent during cranking, very carefully inspect the entirety of the harness and all connectors for any sign of visible damage or electrical connectors that may not be fully seated and ensure that the electrical system is waterproof. If the top end is worn out, or there's a gasket that's not sealing (ie: blown head gasket, leaking base gasket) the motor could be low on compression, and low compression certainly will make an engine hard to start, if you can get it running at all. If you're suspecting low compression, be sure to check out our article on performing a compression test as doing so will give you an idea of the condition of the top end, at which time, If the top end proves to be in need of service, be sure to grab a factory service manual specific to the bike you're working on, and on the way back together, be sure to stay on top of oil changes and air filter services to prolong the life of the top end. Got a clean air filter, clean gas in the tank that's reaching the engine and good compression? After you've been over everything listed above and have come to the conclusion that there's no spark, there are a few common reasons for a no spark condition which you should check before taking on a complex electronic ignition system. Ignition systems produce voltage in the thousands of volts so its advised to NOT be in contact with the ignition system when attempting to start a dirt bike. Although the shock is DC and generally harmless, If you get 'hit' by the secondary ignition system via a spark plug wire, a coil, or a coil on plug setup, you'll find that you'll let go in an INSTANT, but getting shocked is easily avoidable by not holding or touching ignition components during cranking or running of a motorcycle. If you're left with an electric start motorcycle that appears lifeless but has a backup kick starter, by all means you should attempt to start it with the kick start so as to ensure that the engine turns freely.
