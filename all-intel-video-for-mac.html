During the same event, Apple also announced the availability of a Developer Transition Kit, consisting of an Intel-based Mac development system along with preview versions of Apple's software, which will allow developers to prepare versions of their applications to run on both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs.</p><h3>It all starts with Intel® Core™ Duo processors</h3><p>The groundbreaking design of Intel Core Duo processors brings new levels of PC performance and energy efficiency, and the potential for new, innovative, consumer-friendly designs. Its dual-core technology rewrites the rules of computing and delivers optimized power efficiency-for breakthrough performance with amazingly low power consumption.<br> The Intel Core Duo is comprised of two processors (cores) engineered onto a single chip, offering virtually twice the computational power of a traditional single processor in the same footprint. With two cores tightly integrated, increased L2 cache and a host of engineering breakthroughs, the Intel Core Duo delivers higher performance for all types of applications.</p><p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong></p><p><em>The Intel Core Duo is the first Intel processor built using the new 65-nanometer process, which makes possible transistors so small you could fit a hundred o f them inside a single human cell.</em></p><p>According to Apple CEO Steve Jobs, “It's been 10 years since our transition to the PowerPC, and we think Intel's technology will help us create the best personal computers for the next 10 years.” Intel President/CEO Paul Otellini was similarly enthusiastic: “We look forward to providing advanced chip technologies, and to collaborating on new initiatives, to help Apple continue to deliver innovative products for years to come.”<br><strong>Intel embraces Mac developers</strong><br> In conjunction with the WWDC announcement, working closely with Apple, Intel applied the finishing touches on a wide range of new software development tools and resources to be available through http://software.intel.com. The goal? Helping Apple developers take advantage of Intel Core Duo processor technologies to maximize application performance on the new Intel-based Mac platforms.<br> With help from Intel, software developers are delivering powerful new applications of all kinds for the new Macintosh models-from programming to office productivity, engineering, design and just about anything else you can imagine.<br> “We think this is a really smart move on Apple's part and plan to create future versions of our Creative Suite for Macintosh that support both PowerPC and Intel processors,” said Bruce Chizen, CEO of Adobe.</p><h2 id='intel-all-in-one'>Intel All In One</h2><h3>Software development for Intel-based Macs: smoothing the transition</h3><p>As part of Intel’s commitment to the Mac development community, Intel Compilers and Libraries help software developers deliver improved performance for their applications running on the new Macs, providing a fast, easy way to optimize application performance and integrate with the Xcode* development environment.</p><p><strong>Intel Compilers for Mac OS include:</strong></p><p><strong>Intel® Fortran Compiler for Mac OS</strong>* -a fast, easy way to get maximum application performance for compute-intensive applications.
