Use these steps to format external hard drives for both operating systems.</h2><p>Western Digital (WD) portable hard drives are really helpful. They offer high capacity storage, universal connectivity and are also compatible with USB 3.0 and 2.0. If you want the WD external hard drive to work on your Mac or PC, you need to format it first.

Eventually you will find out that you may not be working on the same operating system (OS) as others. If you work solely on a Mac, but need to send files to someone working on a PC, your external hard drive needs to be set up for both operating systems. Let’s take a look at the different types of formats, and which are best for video production.</p><h3>Formatting the Hard Drive</h3><p>A vast majority of <strong>video production will be done on a Mac or Windows operating system</strong>, so we aren’t going to cover Linux. Hard drives set up for use on Windows machines only will often use <em><strong>NTFS</strong></em>, while Macs will use <em><strong>HFS+</strong></em>. That said, if you are using both a PC and Mac in the workflow, you’ll need to use a different format.</p><p><em>Image from Shutterstock</em></p><p>You may be using only Macs or PCs in your own office, but you will also need to take into account what type of machines your client is using. If you need to send them RAW files or an edited sequence, you will need to make sure the external hard drive is set up for both operating systems. To do this, you will need to use either <em><strong>exFAT</strong></em> or <em><strong>FAT32</strong></em> formats. <strong>This will allow you to use the hard drive on both a Mac and PC. </strong></p><p>FAT32 is often used among general users, but <strong>FAT32 has limitations that can affect filmmakers</strong>. FAT32 has a maximum file size of 4 GB per file. The limitation affects both Mac and PC users. A single high resolution file can easily go over 4 GB, so Fat32 may not the best format. <strong>The best format for video production is exFAT</strong>. The maximum individual file size for exFAT is 16 EB. 1 EB, or exabyte, is 1 billion GB. That said, if you are using smaller file sizes — FAT32 can suffice.</p><h3>Format Hard Drive (Mac)</h3><p>1.

This includes the way you name the drive and how you label it.</p><p>One of my personal tricks is naming all drives after an actor. For instance, one project had several external drives, all of which were named after different Will Ferrell characters — Mugatu, Megamind, Lord Business, and Ron Burgundy. Another project used Tom Hanks characters — Forrest and Woody.</p><p><em>Remember that external drives should be used temporarily — and all footage should be backed up elsewhere. Use checksum verification to make sure everything is copied correctly. </em></p><p>There are plenty of ways you can label your drives. You can simply use some masking tape or gaff tape, and then write the name of the drive. You can also use hard drive labels, which are the awesome stickers featured above. You easily put them on your external drive to keep track of them.</p><p>If you are a parent, like myself, you can also use any stickers you have lying around the house. I recently had Kermit the Frog and Optimus Prime hard drives.</p><img src='https://static.kvraudio.com/i/b/drumexperience1.jpg' alt='Cannot' title='Cannot'><p>No matter how you label your hard drives, just make sure you keep track of them. You never know when you will need that footage from a three-year-old project.</p><h2>Format For Mac Hard Drive</h2><p><strong>Got any hard drive organizational tips to share with the community?</strong> Let us know in the comments below!</p><p>Western Digital (WD) portable hard drives are really helpful.
