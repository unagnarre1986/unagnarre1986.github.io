video production, others have more ambitious ideas when it comes to pushing Apple‚Äôs top of the line Mac to the limit. Recently, Jonathan Morrison decided to see just how many tabs he could open on Google Chrome before his computer went haywire. And best of all, he chronicled the entire ordeal on a somewhat fascinating and hilarious Twitter thread.</p><p>Now we‚Äôve all fallen victim to opening up too many tabs in Chrome and having our computer grind to a frustrating halt. But for most people, I‚Äôm guessing, the upper limit of their open tabs on Chrome is probably more than 50 but less than 100. Morrison, armed with Apple‚Äôs state of the art Mac Pro, was able to open more than 6000 Google Chrome tabs.</p><ol><li>MacBook Pro (From $1,299.99 at Best Buy) Google Chromecast (For $69.99 at Best Buy) How to Chromecast from a Mac computer.

It utilizes very fast loading of Web pages and has a V8 engine, which is a custom built JavaScript engine. Because Google has used parts from Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox browsers, they made the project open source.</p><p>When Morrison hit the 3,000 tab mark, Chrome was using up about 126GB of RAM. By the time Morrison hit 5,000 tabs, Chrome was using up 170GB of RAM.</p><p>Looking to push things to the limit, Morrison kept on opening up tabs until he got to a whopping 6,000. By that point, his Mac Pro was seemingly on the fritz, as evidenced by the tweet below.</p><p>guys it's climbing rapidly computer might explode lol pic.twitter.com/0WWa5piSnB</p><p>‚Äî Jonathan Morrison üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (@tldtoday) February 7, 2020</p><p>And then things kept climbing, with Chrome eventually using up a lot more than a full TB of RAM.</p><p>send help pic.twitter.com/CVgMDf5pIC</p><p>‚Äî Jonathan Morrison üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (@tldtoday) February 7, 2020</p><p>legit worried now pic.twitter.com/KeeY81bJkk</p><h3 id='google-chrome-for-mac-pro-book'>Google Chrome For Mac Pro Book</h3><p>‚Äî Jonathan Morrison üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (@tldtoday) February 7, 2020</p><img src='https://static.digitecgalaxus.ch/Files/3/2/9/2/2/2/9/9/apple_mac_pro_max_out_hero21.jpeg?impolicy=PictureComponent&resizeWidth=828&resizeHeight=414' alt='Chrome For Mac Pro' title='Chrome For Mac Pro'><p>Not to be outdone, Morrison subsequently posted a few posts on Twitter that show a computer running 12,000!
