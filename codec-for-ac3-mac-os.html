You may find that the media player on your Mac gives an error whenever you play an MP4 file. To solve this, you need a codec. An <strong>MP4 codec</strong> enables the media players such as QuickTime to play files that it did not support such as MP4 files. Although QuickTime on Mac devices supports MP4 files, it only contains some of the codecs, which means that if your file has a codec that is not supported, it will not play. Therefore, you should install the required codec or convert the files to a format support by the media player. </p><h2> Part 1. Best MP4 Codec to Play MP4 Videos on Mac </h2><p> UniConverter is the best MP4 codec that can enable playing of MP4 videos on Mac devices. The converter is a tool used to convert videos and audio from one format to another. In this case, it can convert the MP4 files on your Mac device to a format that is recognized by the media player. Other than converting, the software can also be used for editing videos, burning DVDs and downloading audio and video files from various sharing sites. </p><h3>Video Converter - UniConverter </h3><p> Get the Best MP4 Codec: </p><ul><li> Convert MP4 videos to Mac compatible format with only three simple steps. </li><li> Convert MP4 videos to many more video/audio formats as you need. </li><li> Download online videos from various video sharing websites. </li><li> Burn MP4 or any to DVD, copy DVD file as a backup. </li><li> Edit your MP4 videos files before conversion. </li><li> Preserve the original video quality after conversion. </li></ul><h3> Simple Steps to Convert MP4 Files on Mac with the Best MP4 Codec </h3><h4><strong>Step 1. Importing MP4 files</strong></h4><p> You can convert audio, DVD and video files. To place the files in the converter, you can import them in two ways. One method is by dragging and dropping them to the converter’s window. You may also go to the main menu and select 'Add Files' to achieve this. </p><h4><strong>Step 2. Set output format</strong></h4><p> The program supports more than 150 formats. Choose the one compatible with the media player in your Mac. You will find the formats grouped into six categories. Here, the recommended format is 'MOV'. </p><h4><strong>Step 3. Start Conversion</strong></h4><p> The conversion begins when you click the 'Convert' button. Once the conversion is complete, a prompt message appears asking you if to open the folder. If your output was for devices such as iPad, iPod, iPhone or Apple TV, they are automatically added to the iTunes library. The converted format can now play on your Mac device while retaining the original quality. </p><h2> Part 2. Recommend Another Three MP4 Codec Pack for Mac </h2><h3><strong>#1. Perian</strong></h3><p>Perian is a QuickTime component that adds codec to QuickTime to enable it play videos and audio that it is not currently supporting such as MP4. By installing perian, your device can play a wide variety of formats including AVI, DivX, MKV, MP4 and FLV. </p><p><strong>Pros:</strong><br> Supports many media files. <br><strong>Cons:</strong><br> It is no longer being developed. <br> It only works with earlier versions of QuickTime such as 7.6.6 and not 10. </p><p>Warning: These instructions are for i386 Linux; trying this on x64 Linux has failed. Update 2013-12-13: cross compiling from Linux for macOS no longer works at all for 10.8 and above. The compiler works fine but viable linker tools (cctools for linux) are not available for Linux anymore. <a href='/compiling-for-mac-on-linux.html'>Compiling for mac on linux</a>. @jcoffland No, the other way around. It's for building OS X applications on Linux. 'Cross-Compiling on Linux for Mac OS X 10.3 - 10.5' (emphasis added).

Aiseesoft MP4 Converter for Mac</strong></h3><p>Aiseesoft MP4 converter converts video and audio to and from MP4 on Mac devices.
