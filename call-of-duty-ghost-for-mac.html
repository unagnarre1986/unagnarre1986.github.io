He first appears as a main playable character in the 2007 video game <i>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</i> where he is part of the 22nd Special Air Service (SAS) regiment as a sniper and demolitions expert.</p><p>He later appears in the sequel <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</i>, released in November 2009, as both an NPC and as one of the playable characters. He also appeared in <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</i>, released in November 2011. In both games John 'Soap' MacTavish plays the role of Captain and Field Commander of Task Force 141 along with Captain John Price who also appears alongside him in the original three titles.</p><p>MacTavish is voiced by Scottish actor Kevin McKidd in <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> and <i>Modern Warfare 3</i>.<sup>[1]</sup></p><h2><span>Overview</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><p>John 'Soap' MacTavish plays a key role in the storyline of <i>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</i> where he is on the front lines of the fight against the Ultra-nationalists as part of the SAS, more specifically Captain Price's Bravo Team. In <i>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</i>, the player experiences the storyline through the eyes of Soap however certain missions were played from a different characters perspective. Soap appears to be modeled after the character 'Lake' in the 2003 movie <i>Tears of the Sun</i>.<sup>[2]</sup></p><p>The later games present MacTavish as a non-playable character (NPC) that the playable character fights alongside. However, in <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</i> the player takes control of MacTavish in the final three missions. In the final game in the series, MacTavish appears as a playable character only for the first mission then reverts to an NPC for the remainder of the storyline.</p><p>MacTavish is later killed in action during the course of <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</i> after an explosion where he experiences massive blood loss, whilst on a mission to assassinate Vladimir Makarov, a continuing antagonist of the series appearing in all three titles.</p><p>The developers of <i>Call of Duty: Ghosts</i> added a DLC (Downloadable Content Package) which allowed the player to play as the iconic character called the Soap Legend Pack which was released in April 2014.<sup>[3]</sup></p><p>The fourth season of Call of Duty: Mobile features Soap as a playable avatar upon purchase of the season battle pass.<sup>[4]</sup></p><h2><span>Plot appearances</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><h3><span><i>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</i></span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h3><p>MacTavish is first introduced in the opening mission, after having been selected for the 22nd SAS, based at Hereford. He is introduced to fellow squadmates as well as his new commanding officer, Captain John Price, where he undergoes a routine training exercise in the killing house before proceeding on a mission to infiltrate a container ship in the Bering Strait and retrieve a nuclear device. He is part of the team responsible for the capture and execution of Khaled Al-Assad, the man responsible for the detonation of a similar nuclear device in an unnamed Middle Eastern country, and also the death of Imran Zakhaev, the man responsible for providing Al-Assad nuclear weapons. Soap is part of Bravo Team, which works with US Marine Force Recon in disabling nuclear missiles which Zakhaev launched at the shores of the United States, where he later kills Zakhaev after an Mi-24 Hind destroys a major bridge on their evacuation route. Soap and Price are barely spared the untimely death their squad received when a diversion created by Russian loyalists buys Soap time sufficient to kill Zakhaev and two soldiers with Price's M1911 pistol.</p><h3><span><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</i></span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h3><div>John 'Soap' MacTavish as he appears in <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</i></div><p>Soap makes his appearance in <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> as Captain of Task Force 141, a promotion he received in the aftermath of Operation Kingfish, where Price was captured and taken to a gulag in eastern Russia after an attempt on the life of Vladimir Makarov, Zakhaev's former top lieutenant. He appears on the mission 'Cliffhanger' as an NPC, assisting the player's character, Gary 'Roach' Sanderson. In the following mission where the player controls Roach, MacTavish and his team capture the right-hand man of an arms dealer and interrogate him, which then leads them to hunt for Alejandro Rojas, whom they captured in time, which leads to the rescue of Captain Price – the man Makarov hates most. In the final three missions of the game, he and Price discover that their commanding officer, Lt. General Shepherd had double-crossed them, but are unable to warn their team (Ghost and Roach) in time and they are subsequently killed. After battling through a massive battalion of armed military contractors (dubbed Shadow Company,) Soap attempts to kill Shepherd with his combat knife, but Shepherd manages to stab him in the chest. With Shepherd distracted by a hand to hand duel with Price, and with what little strength he had left, Soap pulled the knife from his chest and threw it, directly hitting Shepherd in his eye and killing him instantly. Price patches up Soap when their friend Nikolai lands near their pickup point and extracts them to safety, setting the stage for Modern Warfare 3.</p><h3><span><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</i></span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h3><p>Hours after being extracted from Site Hotel Bravo, Task Force 141 has been disavowed and a dying Soap has been extracted to a Russian loyalist holdout in India. With Makarov on their trail to tie up loose ends and a quick patch job by a loyalist doctor, loyalist Yuri joins Bravo Team in escaping the relentless assault by Russian ultranationalists loyal to Makarov to lay low while Russia is engaged in all-out combat with the United States across the eastern seaboard. Sometime later, Price contacts former 141 operator Sandman who they worked with during Operation Kingfish for assistance with leads on Makarov's location, as well as SAS commanding officer MacMillan, Price's former captain in the SAS with whom he worked during the initial attempt to kill Imran Zakhaev 20 years prior to the events of Modern Warfare 3 (15 prior to the events of Call of Duty 4.) After retrieving intel from a number of sources and with help from loyalist Kamarov, the team is able to lock down Makarov's location in a martial law run-down Prague, in the Czech Republic, where Makarov is expected to attend a high-level meeting with other senior officials in his organization. Makarov, however, is aware that 141 is in the city, and, after letting Yuri know he shouldn't have come after them, activates bomb charges intended to kill Soap and Yuri both. Soap saves Yuri's life by pushing him out of the window at the last moment, and is then jettisoned himself from a very high elevation, at which point Soap's previous knife wound is reopened. During an attempted extraction, Soap dies from massive blood loss moments after informing Price that Makarov knows Yuri. Soap is later mentioned by Price when the latter calls MacMillan to let him know that Soap has died and pleads for help in finding Makarov's location. He is mentioned one final time at the beginning of the last mission of the game by Price, who the player takes control of, when he and Yuri suit up in EOD armor, says 'This is for Soap.'</p><h2><span>Other appearances</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><p>Due to the popularity of the character, an Xbox 360 user avatar was released for purchase, which allows players to look like Soap.<sup>[5]</sup> Similar to the Call of Duty character Captain Price, MacTavish appears in a video posted on YouTube by Machinima entitled 'Captain MacTavish Plays Halo 3', as part of their <i>Call of Duty</i> and <i>Halo</i> crossover series.

Although Call of Duty is very popular among first person shooter games, there have been so many releases in the series that some people may have trouble keeping track of them all. Is Call of Duty Ghosts simply a variation on a theme, or does it offer something new and different? Find out by reading the review. </p><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts presents players with the fast and fluid game play that the original captured so well. People who are familiar with the original game should be able to jump right into the action and should have little trouble figuring out what to do.</p><p>However, Ghosts also introduces players to a brand new gaming premise. The player personalisation is stunning and really captures the feeling that you are playing the game with a team of skilled soldiers. The sweeping changes that the game presents also breathes new life into the old concept and helps make it more original that many people may expect.</p><p>Ghosts is set in a whole new world to the original Call of Duty as well as being slightly in the future. For a change it is the South American nations who pose the threat and gamers must strive to take down the evil forces of South America, who have made their money from dominating the oil markets and are now intent on dominating the world. The plot of the game is fairly simple and often feels like it is a bit too simple. Fans of great storylines may find that this is a little lacking in content. </p><p>There is plenty to do in Ghosts and missions are extensive and engaging. Although the campaigns are a little complicated at times, there really force gamers to use all of their skills and work hard to achieve their goals. Fortunately the controls are rather easy to manage and players should not be confused for long. </p><img src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/halo/images/4/4a/VoiView.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080622163300' alt='Call' title='Call'><p>The world of Ghosts is rich and varied and there is a lot of area to explore. The varied scenery leads to a wide range of different tasks for players to complete such as flying helicopters over lush jungle, rappelling down skyscrapers and even engaging in firefights with the enemy in Outer Space. The whole Ghosts world is presented in a single map, which is extremely large and can be rather confusing at first.</p><img src='https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91uuI%2BHPF6L._SL1500_.jpg' alt='Call of duty ghost wiki' title='Call of duty ghost wiki'><p>There are so many new elements to Ghosts that gamers can enjoy the thrill of not quite knowing what is coming next. One minute you may find that you have to put all of your speed and strategy to the test to evade a group of hungry sharks. In the next scene you may need to take on the role of a dog to complete a challenge, which brings with it a whole new range of skills. Each new scenario that players are presented with requires a whole new strategy and this game is certainly going to keep gamers on their toes, making it anything but boring. </p><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts includes many of the great features that fans of Call of Duty have come to know and love. There are enough extra elements to make this game feel fresh and exciting, despite a few small setbacks. However, like many franchises the story has been skipped over a little this time around, which is a bit of a disappointment. </p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>More team focus</li><li>Campaigns are exciting and engaging</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><h2 id='call-of-duty-ghost-mace'>Call Of Duty Ghost Mace</h2><ul><li>The maps are too big</li><li>The story is rather basic</li></ul></div></div><div class="area-layer-block alt"><div class="area-layer-block-body"></div></div><footer class="page-md-container"></footer></article><nav id="bar-primary-new"><h1 class="clear-site-col primary-row-label">Post navigation</h1><div class="navigation-main-lg"><a href="/uninstaller-tool-for-mac.html">Uninstaller Tool For Mac</a></div><div class="navigation-items-secondary"><a href="/torrent-tweetbot-for-mac.html">Torrent Tweetbot For Mac</a></div></nav></div><div id="menu-block-bar" class="clear-node-page solid aside-body-secondary" role="complementary"><aside id="md-aside-content" class="sm-page-body"><div class="md-aside-content-body"><div class="md-aside-content-body-inner"><div class="container-box-extra">Latest Posts</div><ul><li><a href='/best-game-for-mac-download.html' title="Look Call Of Duty Ghost For Mac">Best Game For Mac Download</a></li><li><a href='/dvdvideosoft-youtube-download-for-mac.html' title="Look Call Of Duty Ghost For Mac">Dvdvideosoft Youtube Download For Mac</a></li><li><a href='/hide-my-ip-address-for-mac.html' title="Look Call Of Duty Ghost For Mac">Hide My Ip Address For Mac</a></li><li><a href='/1password-for-mac-crack.html' title="Look Call Of Duty Ghost For Mac">1password For Mac Crack</a></li><li><a href='/usb-serial-converter-driver-for-mac.html' title="Look Call Of Duty Ghost For Mac">Usb Serial Converter Driver For Mac</a></li><li><a href='/application-torrents-for-mac.html' title="Look Call Of Duty Ghost For Mac">Application Torrents For Mac</a></li><li><a href='/betternet-for-mac.html' title="Look Call Of Duty Ghost For Mac">Betternet For Mac</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div></div><footer id="abbr-clear" role="contentinfo"><div id="singular-row-page"><div class="singular-row-page-body"><div class="singular-row-page-body-inner">&copy; &#9776; github.go-to-app.com            </div></div></div></footer></div></div></body></html>
